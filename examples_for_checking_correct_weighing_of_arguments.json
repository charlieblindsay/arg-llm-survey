Therefore, when a subagent indicates that their acts are made on behalf of the principal, these acts are legally binding on the principal, as per Article 99(1), which states that a manifestation of intention by an agent indicating that they will act on behalf of the principal binds the principal directly.

Therefore, it logically follows that a defendant in such a case can assert non-neglect of supervisory duty as an affirmative defense against the plaintiff's claim for damages, which is in line with Article 714(2) extending this liability to those supervising on behalf of the statutory supervisor.",
